 ## Description
This Repository contains code for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp's Challenge 14 " Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog". 

For this This week's challenge, we were tasked  to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. We are to build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. The app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
